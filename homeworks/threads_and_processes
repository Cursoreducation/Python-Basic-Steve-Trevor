1. Write the method that return the number of threads currently in execution. 
Also prepare the method that will be executed with threads and run during the first method counting.

2. Print current date by using 2 threads.
#1. Define a subclass using Thread class.
#2. Instantiate the subclass and trigger the thread. 

3. Use Pool.apply() to get the row wise common items in list_a and list_b.
list_a = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7, 8], [10, 11, 12], [20, 21]]
list_b = [[2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14], [21, 24, 25]]

4. Divide the work between 2 methods: print_cube that returns the cube of number 
and print_square that returns the square of number. These two methods should be executed by using 2 different processes.
